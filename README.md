## 🔧 Workflow Steps


### 1. Assessment Intake
Collect, validate and normalize content metadata from SIS; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. Retrieve
Execute retrieve phase for the RAG pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Ground
Execute ground phase for the RAG pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Readiness Check
Readiness Check across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Practice Recommendation
Practice Recommendation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Progress Review
Progress Review across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Parent/Student Notification
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to Identity/SSO; return response JSON for the client.
